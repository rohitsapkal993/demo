										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Spring is a passionate and determined group of monthly givers on a mission to end the water crisis in our lifetime. People like you, from more than 100 countries around the world, giving anything they can to prove how unstoppable we are when we work together.</p>
<h4>Clean water helps keep kids in school, especially girls.</h4>
<p>Less time collecting water means more time in class. Clean water and proper toilets at school means teenage girls don’t have to stay home for a week out of every month.</p>

<h3>How do we tackle the water crisis?</h3>
<p>We work with local experts and community members to find the best sustainable solution in each place where we work, whether it’s a well, a piped system, a BioSand Filter, or a system for harvesting rainwater. And with every water point we fund, our partners coordinate sanitation and hygiene training, and establish a local Water Committee to help keep water flowing for years to come.</p>
